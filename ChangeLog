             - !/bin/sh replaced by !/bin/bash because of "function"

             - update onto automake 1.9, autoconf 2.13.56,

             - automatically import of generated .cvsignore-files
	       into the subversion property-list using the command
	       "svn propset svn:ignore -F .cvsignore .". This command
	       will be executed in all directories if it has already
	       been set und subversion control (.svn-directory exists)
2004-??-?? : - published  release 2.1 
             - inserted the new maintainer mail adress
2003-02-22 : - published release 2.0 
             - automatically generated prj.spec - file for
	       building the corresponding rpm
	     - some improvements concerning the file headers
	       and their licence-headers 
2002-06-16 : - AC_PROG_RANLIB\nAM_PROG_LIBTOOL replaced by AC_PROG_LIBTOOL
               accordingliy to libtool release 1.3.d
	       (thanks to ralph schunk for this hint)
2002-05-27 : - gptg now writes an improved version of the reconf-script
2002-05-12 : - scripts prepared for usage with automake 1.6.x ...
             - libtoolize integrated into reconf file for
	       generating the ltmain.sh link
	       (Note: you might meet the following bug-messages:
	       "Using `AC_PROG_RANLIB' is rendered obsolete by `AC_PROG_LIBTOOL'
	       You should add the contents of `...libtool.m4' to `aclocal.m4'"
	       This messages seems to be evoked by an incompatibility between
	       automake, aclocal and libtools. But not to call libtoolize
	       evokes that the there won't be generatd a link to the
	       ltmain.sh - script. Therefore you can and should ignore
	       this libtool.m4-fault message. )
	     - reconf now regenerates all derivatable files
	       and links
	     - a prepare-cvs-import.sh will be generated
	       which deletes all derivatable files and links
               < using make distclean and the knowledge
		about the autoconf/automake files and links >
	       and which generates intial versions of
	       .cvsignore files containing those files and
	       links which are derivatable using reconf,
	       autoconf and automake ...
	     - some minor bug-fixes
2001-03-02 : - namespace gtgt as example inserted
             - better respecting of the c++ coding standard
