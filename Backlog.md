# GTGT / release <#4.0.0#> Backlog

*Copyright (C) Karsten Reincke, Deutsche Telekom AG - 2020*

*gtgt* was started in the year 2000 lived a while and then slept for a long time in the cemetery of discarded software. In that meantime, much has developed, particularly concerning the autotools themselves, the programming languages, the development environments, and the open source compliance.

By reactivating *gtgt* we couldn't take into account all the new trends. So, we added this file to pick up and cover ideas and wishes that are worth to be implemented but that we haven't yet planned:

* Add a license management by which one can license the files under different open source licenses (= adding different licensing file headers)
* Initialize the sources for java, php, ruby , and other languages
* Automate the creation of the health documents (just as ``automake --add-missing does``, but with the better format *md* and *yaml*)
