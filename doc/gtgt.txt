gitty-gitty, the (general | GNU) template generation tools,
are a set of scripts for creating a whole set of sources
which may already be compiled and installed using the GNU
development tools.

Think of gtgt as a program which is able to create an already
compilable, very sophisticated "hello world" program, written
in C or C++ and constituted by a main program, two internal
modules (classes), and one static and one shared library. 

This complex "Hello World" is already fully embedded into
the GNU autoconf/automake development environment. By using
gitty-gitty, you will get a template of sources for the main
cases you might meet, and which you can also use as examples
for automake, autoconf, etc. 

gtgt (Gnu-Template-Generation-Tools) are scripts to create
a sophisticated teaching "hello world" written in C or C++:
You can see how to use modules/classes static and shared
libraries, all being documented by doxygen
and fully embedded into GNU automake.
