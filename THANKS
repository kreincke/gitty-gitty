GTGT THANKS file

The project GTGT has originally been initiated by karsten reincke.
Many people have further contributed to GTGT by reporting problems, 
suggesting various improvements, or submitting actual code. Here is
a list of these people. Help me keep it complete and exempt of errors.

--- Christian Heissing
    has tested and corrected the first published version 0.8
    
--- Eleftherios Gkioulekas
    is the main person who must be named at this point: he wrote not only
    the autotools, but the handout: learning the GNU development tools
    both have been a base for the general software-project prepare-tools,
    the autotools as scipt-base and the handout as learning-base.
    
--- Guido Sassmannshausen
    has corrected the documentation
    
--- ICDM (http://www.icdm.de mailto:dialog@icdm.de)
    my company, which wants to have such software-project prepare-tools,
    which has decided to reform gnu-software and which therefore has 
    decided to give new gnu-software back.
