GTGT THANKS file

The project GTGT has originally been initiated by Karsten Reincke.
Many people have further contributed to GTGT by reporting problems,
suggesting various improvements, or submitting actual code. Here is
a list of these people. Help me keep it complete and exempt of errors.

--- Christian Heissing
    has tested and corrected the first published version 0.8

--- Eleftherios Gkioulekas
    is the main person who must be named at this point: he wrote not only
    the autotools, but the handout: learning the GNU development tools
    both have been a base for the general software-project prepare-tools,
    the autotools as scipt-base and the handout as learning-base.

--- Guido Sassmannshausen
    has corrected the documentation

--- ICDM (http://www.icdm.de)
    my company in the year 2000, which wanted to get such software-project prepare-tools, decided to reform gnu-software and to give the new gnu-software back to the community

--- Deutsche Telekom AG (http://www.telekom.com)
    My employer in the year 2020 (and many other years before) who decided to use this tool set as a working base for implementing a test driven working model in the OpenChain tooling working group
