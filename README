Three scripts are constituting general-project-template-generate-tools:
gcng , gscg and gptg. they can be installed using the normal mode:

./configure --prefix=/whereever/youwant/tohave/them
make
su 
make install

the three scripts offer the following possibilities:

gcng = general-copyright-note-generator
       --------------------------------
       script of generating files which already contain the correct
       copyright-header regardless which copyright shall and
       which programming-language shall be used
                    
gscg = general-source-code-generator
       --------------------------------
       script for generating all already compilable source-files of 
       a software-module, namely the header-file as module-declaration
       and the source-file as module-defintion. 
                    
       you can select c or c++ as that programming-language, which is
       used for writing the functions. think gsng as program, which is 
       able to create very sophisticated hello-world-modules.
                    
gptg = general-project-template-generator
       ----------------------------------
                    
       script for generating the whole set of files for an already 
       compilable and installable software-project: using gscg 
       + gcng too gptg will offer a project-directory which is 
       totally prepared for the use of autoconf and automake
       and which contains a hello-program - being built up from two
       modules and one static library -  and which offers already a
       shared library.
                    
       so you get a template, which only must be adopted 
       to what you want to have.
